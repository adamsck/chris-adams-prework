                    Chris is a jack of all trades. He spends most of his day corralling 7th graders and finding someway to make them interested in U.S. History. When not in the classroom, Chris can usually be found on the soccer fields, where he has helped rebuild two major metro varsity soccer programs over the past eight seasons.

                        His home life consists of spending time with his fellow teacher and superhero of a wife. He is the father of perhaps the only girl whose shared love of horse-racing caused her to request a 4th birthday party themed after her favorite jockey. His 18 month old daughter is a ravenous desert vulture who leaves no chocolate untasted.

                        In a past life, Chris was a multi-sport athlete, actor, and dancer, even spending a handful years performing family-friendly standup comedy around the Twin Cities.
